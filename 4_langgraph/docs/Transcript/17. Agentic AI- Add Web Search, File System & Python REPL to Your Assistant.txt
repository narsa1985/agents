Would you believe it's already day five of week four?

Here we are completing our sidekick project.

I'm so happy!

I love this project and I'm now such a fan of Landgraf.

Over the course of the week, uh, we're going to be talking today about tools, tools and more tools

we're going to be building in, uh, the same tool that we know and love already about searching the

web, not navigating a browser, but doing the web search, uh, using the Serp API that we've used

before.

We're going to send push notifications because why not?

We know how to do that.

We're also going to add a tool to use the file system to be able to write files, so that we can have

our operator agent that we're building our, our coworker that we have with our sidekick be able to

read and write files from the file system.

We're going to have it have access to Wikipedia so that it can look things up.

And we're even going to give it the ability to run Python code itself.

Not not in a Docker container like we did before.

This time it's just going to have the ability to execute some Python.

And so we're really giving it unfettered access to do things on our machine while we watch and while

we monitor.

And that leads me to a big point.

Uh, the sidekick app that we're about to build is an experimental app.

It's something for you to work with and to monitor and watch and use it for your own purposes.

This is this is an app for commercial purposes for you, for you to be able to get more and do more

with an AI agent at your side.

But in doing so, it doesn't have guardrails.

It's something which is, uh, open to the wild.

And as such, it needs to be treated with some caution.

And that's the first thing I want to say.

Use sidekick at your own risk.

If you're not comfortable with this, if you're not sure about the technologies behind it and so on,

then please do remove the Python Repl tool that we'll we'll add.

You should remove it and even remove the online navigation tools until you're, you're comfortable with

what's going on.

And you can watch it.

This is an agent that we are allowing to roam free.

Now of course when it's using the browser it's using it's using chromium, the open source version of

Chrome.

And it doesn't have access to any of our cookies or any of our passwords in a password manager or something

like that.

So it's not able to do anything like log in or it doesn't have access to credit cards and so on.

And the file manager is is within a certain directory, so it can't roam free on your computer.

The Python wrapper is that's pretty open.

It can run any Python it wants, which would allow it potentially to write something that could that

could do uh, do some damage.

Uh, so you could remove that if you're, if you're concerned.

But it does seem extremely unlikely.

But nonetheless you need to be comfortable with it.

You need to do it at your own risk please.

The the other thing I want to say is that the sidekick app is a starting point.

See it as a canvas.

I've built something up with some prompts and some tools, and I've discovered that I can make it do

great things for me.

It actually did some work for me, some real work, some commercial work that I needed to do, and it

did it for me and produced a report and it was something that I used.

So.

So it works.

It really works.

And it can deliver commercial benefit for you and be your own sidekick, let alone building it for other

people.

Uh, so see it that way.

But you need to see it as this canvas.

It's something which you need to to make suitable for yourself.

You need to put in the sorts of tools and give it the kind of prompting you need.

When I use it, I find that it sometimes goes awry, and I need to improve my prompts and make various

changes to it to keep it on track.

And that's what you have to do.

It will require experimentation, and if you do so, it will pay dividends.

And that's my final point.

There's so much opportunity with this.

This really unleashes a gigantic eye.

But this is like it's like you're building your own madness.

If you find if you find agents like, like madness from the Chinese startup that that was able to do

things like hunt for good, rent in apartments and build websites and things, this is like your very

own one that you are building and you are controlling and so you can make it do great things.

Um, but it requires effort put into it to and it will, it will take some investment of your time and

experimentation.

And so I see that see it that way, the good and the bad.

It's a it's a canvas.

It's not a completed product, but there's so much potential.

Well let's get to it.

Here we are in uh, in Cursa, we're looking at, week four, of course, and now we're going to Python

modules, which I know will please some people, but I'm not going to be typing code, but it's going

to be looking at it but going through it carefully.

So sidekick, the application is divided into three Python modules.

There are they are here.

And I'll first give you like a drive by of them.

There is sidekick tools.

And this is the module where we define the different tools that we will use.

So it's nicely packaged up in one place that is going to get us access to a ton of tools, or it's going

to give our agent access to a ton of tools, then sidekick.

Now this is a bit of a long, a long, uh, module here, and maybe this should be broken up a bit.

Um, but it contains a class sidekick, and that has the code that includes our worker, our evaluator,

and the building of the graph.

And we'll come and look through this.

And then thirdly, there is App.py, and that is our Gradio app that manages the user interface side

of it.

Okay.

So with that, let's just spend a couple of minutes on each on each piece.
