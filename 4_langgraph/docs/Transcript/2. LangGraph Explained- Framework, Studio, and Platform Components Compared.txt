So there's one more thing to mention.

One more way in which it's just slightly more complicated.

And that is that Landgraf itself is, in fact three different things, as I alluded to this already.

But Landgraf is in fact Landgraf itself, which is also thought of as the Landgraf framework.

It's a user interface tool called Landgraf Studio, which is one of these kinds of ways that you can

hook things up visually.

So like a visual builder.

And it's something called Landgraf platform, which is the thing that they're sort of promoting on their

website, as if that is Landgraf, uh, Landgraf platform, which is their, um, hosted solution for

deploying and running your agents at scale.

So, Landgraf, which is the framework which is analogous to Cray's framework, Landgraf studio, I

think in Korea it was also called Korea Studio, right?

I think so.

And then Landgraf platform is analogous to CRI enterprise.

And so these are the three offerings.

And I mean, I think to me, I would make the same point that I made with crew, which is that what

what perhaps part of what's going on here is, of course, Landgraf is looking for ways to commercialize

and to monetize their offerings.

And so looking for the enterprise play, the Landgraf platform is about deploying and running your Landgraf

your graphs in their environment, uh, taking advantage of the fact that they've they've got hooks

into everything that they've built.

So I'm sure that if you have built all of your software using Landgraf, then it will be very convenient

to use Landgraf platform.

But I suspect that's what's going on, and I imagine that's why it is sort of promoted and framed so

heavily on their site, as if Landgraf and Landgraf platform are the same thing.

Uh, it's probably because this is the core commercial idea, uh, for for Lange chain and building

this out.

But we are going to be focused, of course, uh, as you can imagine on Landgraf, the framework, that

part of it, that's what we're building to.

We're going to be building our own.

And we'll also be using Lange Smith as well to see what's going on.

Uh, that's going to be interesting for us too.

Now, at this point, I also wanted to do something I wanted to show you the blog post about building

effective agents on Anthropic's website that I mentioned way back in week one, when we were looking

at design patterns.

But I think it's interesting and relevant now because it does show Anthropic's sort of positioning on

this, and it's useful for you to keep this in mind when you think about the difference between what

we're going to do today and what we're going to be doing in week six.

So if we switch to building effective agents, then this this is the blog post you'll find on their

website.

And it's a brilliantly written post.

I've got to tell you, it's really clear it contains within it the different design patterns that I

mentioned.

I hope I think I mentioned that I took the anthropic design patterns right from here.

I thought they're so clear, so, so well explained.

Um, and in addition to that, it has some discussion about using abstraction layers.

And that's really what I wanted to show you here.

So the, the, uh, um, it's says when and how to use frameworks.

So they say there are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including Landgraaf

from Lange chain.

They mention a few others that are not actually so popular, and not as far as I know, although I know

of vellum the business.

But but I don't think that that quite is as big as things like Cru and Autogen and now OpenAI agents

SDK.

But anyway, this is the point I wanted to make.

These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard, low level tasks like calling

llms, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together.

However, they often create extra layers of abstraction and that can obscure the underlying prompts

and responses, making them harder to debug.

They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice.

You can see what Anthropic's getting at.

You can imagine from their point of view, they've got an API.

They've got something that is relatively simple.

Memory can be handled with JSON objects.

Llms can be hooked up simply by calling multiple times.

And so for them, this this idea of building all of this abstraction around it, taking you further

from actually working with the LM itself isn't necessarily something that resonates strongly.

And so they conclude with we suggest that developers start by using LM APIs directly.

Many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code.

If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code.

Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error.

And by customer they mean us customers of anthropic.

So there you go.

I found this really interesting.

It's obviously very clearly written and something that I'm very passionate about.

It is an alternative, a different school of thought.

It is, of course, somewhat, uh, not not in sync with the graph, uh, philosophy thesis of building

this kind of structure.

Uh, so it's interesting to keep that in mind.

And of course, in week six, we're going to see what anthropic brings to the table in the form of MCP,

which is a different way of thinking about it, a protocol, uh, for, for connecting things rather

than building the actual glue itself.

So I wanted to highlight that and give you that perspective, but it's not going to deter us from getting

deep into Landgraaf right now.
