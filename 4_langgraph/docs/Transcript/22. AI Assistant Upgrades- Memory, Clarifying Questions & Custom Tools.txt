And so I hardly need to tell you your challenge for this week.

Your challenge is to make the sidekick your own, build it out, add in tools, add in some tools that

are actually specific to things that you do that are able to to give it powers to do things that you

want to do.

Now, some other more fundamental ways that you can improve it.

One of them that I realized is a note to take from the way that OpenAI does theirs is we could encourage

the, the, the llms to start by asking clarifying questions.

You could have it so that the first thing it does is it asks for three clarifying questions, and then

it uses them as part of its ongoing work.

So that would be a really important change.

Another change would be to build out the graph a bit more.

We've put a lot of power into that one assistant, and the problem with that is that we're expecting

a lot.

We're expecting one model to to be able to to take a lot of different tools and be very flexible.

And the danger is that it loses some of its abilities.

It loses some coherence because the context is so long, because there's so much it can do that it gets

stuck.

And you can improve that by adding more agents to the mix.

For example, you could have a planning agent that first of all, that's the first.

The main assistant is also a planner and decides on what tasks need to be done, and then delegates

them to the execution to the worker.

Um, and so you could do it that way.

These things all have pros and cons.

The benefit is that you've then you're able to divide a bigger problem into smaller steps, and the

autonomous agent can figure out how to do that.

The downside is that it makes it harder for the agents to kind of plot its own course.

And based on what comes out of that first task, maybe it would decide to do things a bit differently

after that.

So by by planning you sort of you lose some of that, that freedom that you get from doing it all with

one agent.

So these are all things to experiment with.

There's no right answer.

More than anything else.

You need to be willing and ready to experiment.

But add on tools, add on a sequel tool that's easy to do.

And on the topic of sequel, you should also improve the memory.

The memory we're using is just the basic in-memory memory, and you should change that to be the sequel

memory that we already did earlier in the week, and just put that in there, and that way it will be

able to remember who you are if you come back, if you use radios, uh, feature to be able to log in

and identify yourself, then you could use your username as the conversation thread and be able to continue

a conversation and keep tasks build up a sort of library of tasks that you have so, so much you could

do with this.

It's a it's like I'm, I'm rather than giving you specific instructions, I'm asking you to be autonomous

with this.

Go and show your own agency and build this into something amazing, absolutely amazing.

And then share it.

Post about it on LinkedIn so I can weigh in and see examples and and show me the tools.

Put them in community contributions so that people can add them in, put in your tools, libraries that

people could import and other functionality.

And I just can't wait to see where people take this project.

And I hope, like me, that you're something of a convert at this point.

Maybe you always did like Landgraf, but but now, uh, now I'm drinking the Kool-Aid.

I'm really, really happy about this week.

It's been very exciting.

And with that, it feels like we were only just starting week four.

And now we're saying goodbye to week four, goodbye to Landgraf, and hello to week five as we move

on to Autogen from Microsoft.

And there's a lot to show you I can't wait.

See you for week five.
