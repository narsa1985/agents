## Overview

### What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention. These systems exhibit agency - the capacity to act independently and make choices based on their understanding of the environment and objectives.

### Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy**: Ability to operate independently
- **Goal-oriented behavior**: Working towards specific objectives
- **Decision-making**: Making choices based on context and data
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting behavior based on feedback and changing conditions
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
