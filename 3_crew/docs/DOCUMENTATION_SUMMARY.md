## Document Structure (Consistent Across All Files)

Each Markdown file follows this 8-section structure:

1. **Simple Explanation** - Plain English overview
2. **Why It Matters** - Interview + real-world relevance
3. **Very Simple Example** - 2-4 line code/scenario
4. **Step-by-Step Workflow** - Numbered steps + Mermaid diagram
5. **Where It Fits** - Healthcare platform integration points
6. **Lab** - Hands-on practice with objectives, steps, outcomes
7. **Interview Questions** - 3 Q&A pairs
8. **Quick Revision Summary** - 3-5 bullet points

## Healthcare Adaptations

### Smart Healthcare AI Platform Integration Points
